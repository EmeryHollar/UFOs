# UFOs
Working with JavaScript

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to add additional filters from the earlier project and add filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sightings. I modified the code from the asynchronous work to create more table filters and allow the user to combine multiple filters at once to search for specific sightings across the dataset. After the user decides which filters they want, all the user must do is hit “enter” and the search criteria will be updated on the user’s screen.
# Results
For starters, once the page is loaded, Dana will see there are now 5 search bars on how to filter the data as shown here. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/170572297-3c4a1822-3618-4396-8bfd-7a74aeddd572.png)
 Dana can filter the data by changing the date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sightings. If Dana only wants to filter the data by date, she can certainly do that, but if she wants to combine a date with a city, to see if there is available data for that specific search, she can now do that as shown here. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100726716/170572590-3548d93b-4c8f-444e-a464-0bfba5b92cac.png)
 
# Summary 
One drawback to the new design of the website, is the fact that the user can not see a list of cities for instance in the dataset on the front end. The search bar for Cities is a great addition to the website; however, a user has to manually enter cities they think might be in the database without seeing a list of cities. A recommendation for further development, would be to add a filter that shows the unique cities in the dataset if the user wants to see that option. This way, the user can then filter the city by specific dates, rather than a more complicated way of manually typing in random cities to see if there is data available. Another recommendation for further development, would be to allow a user to save a search with specific filters they were looking for. This way, the user can search for different criteria and save the results as they search for data.
